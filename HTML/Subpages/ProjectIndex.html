    <h5>My first project (TBD)</h5>
    <p> So this project is a data-stripping / web-scraper that looks for data over the internet. I think this is a crucial skill where all data is online, and being resourceful and scraping data from the internet was critical for the next stage of the plan. I plan on using Beautiful Soup, and python to access the internet to gather data.</p>

    <h5>My second project (TBD)</h5>
    <p> The second phase of my project is using google sheet's API to store the data I've scraped from the web. And data science techniques, starting from simple linear regression (from the data I had made about my weight), to decision trees, k-closest-neightbors, and a perceptron to analyze and make predictions about the data.</p>

    <h5>My third project (TBD)</h5>
    <p> The last phase of my project is to display these results in a clear and fascinating way. This is where this website will be the example. I used javascript, HTML, and CSS to create an inviting website, to show off passions projects, host blogs, and link my journey through these projects with youtube. </p>
